# Machine Learning Playground

*More learning adventures in machine learning!*

---

Welcome! Here, I will be sharing a collection of mini-projects that I did related to *machine learning*. In it's current state, most of the problems will be related to reinforcement learning and using [OpenAI's Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments, as they are easy to use and require minimal environment setup.

The projects of the same problem/environment will be placed in the same folder. Each of them may have various solutions and approaches, documented in Jupyer notebooks. These notebooks are created in Google Colaboratory, so some features such as replay videos can only be viewed there (links to open them there are provided)
